Project Rheopt, published as " Statistical optimization and sensitivity analysis of rheological models using cassava starch " involve preliminary investigations 
into the flow behavior of starch. If starch would one day be a potential substitute for plastics, then there is a need to understand its flow behavior. Hence, rheological characterization.
